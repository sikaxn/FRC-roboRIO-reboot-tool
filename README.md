1. Replace ```roboRIO-9999-FRC.lan``` with your team's roboRIO mDNS address or IP address (or just replace 9999 with your team number).
2. Ensure ```ssh``` can be used from CLI. [This Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh) might help you a bit.
3. Run ```rio-reboot.ps1``` from powershell and your roboRIO will reboot.
